<div id="guide-header">
  You've activated the Raman+IR in-app guide. <br>
  In this guide, you will learn how to
  use the app to compute the <b>Raman/IR</b> spectra and <b>dielectric properties</b> 
  (dielectric and Raman tensors, Born effective charges) of bulk silicon (Si). <br>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Pre-requisite:</b> This guide assumes that you already followed the 
    <b>Relaxation and electronic structure</b> &rarr; <b>Basic tutorial</b> guide, 
    or that you are already familiar with the app.

  Click on <b>Step 1: Select structure</b> and follow the instructions to proceed.

<div id="structure-step">
  In the structure selection step, we select the silicon structure from the examples. <br>

    <h4>Tasks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Click</b> on the "From examples" tab</li>

<div id="configuration-step">
  In this second step (Configure workflow), we define the parameters needed to 
  perform the calculation.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <b>Full geometry</b>, i.e. we optimize both cell parameters and atomic positions. 
        This is important when computing phonons, as we are interested in the 
        curvature of the energy at its minimum (i.e., where forces are zero).</li>
      <li>Open <b>Step 2.1</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="properties-selection">
  Here we select the properties to calculate. Each property is associated with a
  workflow that will submit one or more calculations.

    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Tick the <b>Vibrational Spectroscopy (phonons)</b> checkbox</li>
      <li>Open <b>Step 2.2</b> for further instructions</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="calculation-settings">
  Here we can customize the calculation parameters. 
  The settings are divided into several tabs. 
  You should have already explored the basic and advanced settings in 
  earlier in-app guides.

  Here we note that, since we selected the plugin for vibrational spectroscopy, 
  a new tab is present: **Vibrational settings**. We will explore its content 
  later.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Basic settings</b>: top-level calculation settings</li>
    <li><b>Advanced settings</b>: fine-tune the calculations</li>
    <li>
      <b>Plugin settings</b>: parameters for plugin calculations including
      phonon settings (Vibrational settings)
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note that the app pre-configures defaults for most parameters.

</div>

<div id="basic-settings">
  Here we define the basic settings of the simulations.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Since we are simulating silicon, select the <b>Insulator</b> electronic type</li>
        <li>Select the <b>Fast</b> protocol</li>
        <li>See further instructions in the <b>Vibrational settings</b> panel</li>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Note:</b> For the purpose of completing this guide in short time, we will use the <b>Fast</b> protocol for default parameters.
    However, you if dispose of enough computational resources, you can also select Balanced or Stringent.

<div id="phonons-settings">
  In the Vibrational settings panel, we can customize the parameters for the Raman+IR calculation.
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Select <b>IR/Raman and Dielectric in Primitive Cell Approach</b> in the dropdown menu.
          We are only computing phonons at &Gamma;, so we do not need any supercell. 
          Therefore the supercell settings are hidden.</li>

<div id="submission-step">
  <p>
    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.

    You first need to select which code (code executable + computer where this 
    will run) to use for each step of the workflow. The Quantum ESPRESSO app 
    should always install a local Quantum ESPRESSO executable that is sufficient 
    for this tutorial, but you can setup additional codes installed on remote 
    supercomputers. For more information on how to set up codes, please refer to the 
    corresponding

  <h4>Post-guide exercises</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use the app to compute the Raman/IR spectra and dielectric properties of SiO<sub>2</sub> (silicon oxide) and compare the
      results with the ones obtained for silicon. Check that, for SiO<sub>2</sub>, also some IR modes are active.
      In the Vibrational settings, select the same simulation type as used in this example.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the app to compute both phonons dispersion and Raman/IR spectra of bulk silicon. 
      In the Vibrational settings, select the "IR/Raman, Phonons, Dielectric, INS properties" simulation type. 
      This will use a combined workflow to compute the phonon dispersion and the Raman/IR spectra in supercell approach.
